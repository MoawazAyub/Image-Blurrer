<h1>Image Blurrer</h1>

A simple project to compare the difference between adaptive mean filter and simple mean filter.
<h1>How to get started:</h1>
Load main.m. padding.m and convolve2.m should be in the same directory<br>
running padding.m will just add a padding to the original image. If it is run multiple times multiple paddings will be added to the original image<br>
convolve2.m will perform convolution of matrix in variable "MATRIXB"<br>
